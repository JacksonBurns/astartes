# `astartes` Examples

This directory contains a number of Jupyter notebooks to demonstrate the functionalities of `astartes` - see the complete list below:
 - `barrier_prediction_with_RDB7`: train a machine learning model to predict the barrier height in chemical reactions
 - `mlpds_2023_astartes_demo`: demonstration of `astartes` for producing better training splits in chemical data for MLPDS 2023
 - `reproduce_paper_splits`: re-creates the data splits that were originally used in the paper for `astartes`, which are used in the Continuous Integration to ensure reproducibility
 - `split_comparisons`: demonstrates the differences in sampling algorithms and impact on modeling performance using a simple dataset, submitted to US RSE 2023 Conference
 - `train_val_test_split_sklearn_example`: transitioning from `sklearn` to `astartes` made simple!
