name: Reproduce Paper
# This action runs a Jupyter notebook in the examples folder that uses astartes to generate
# train/val/test splits on two datasets (RDB7 and QM9). These dynamically generated splits
# are then compared to the splits which were created at the time of paper writing, to ensure
# that subsequent releases of astartes have backwards compatibility.
